# Deep Learning For Time Series Cookbook


<a href="https://www.packtpub.com/product/deep-learning-for-time-series-cookbook/9781805129233"><img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81fvz3hf2rL._SL1500_.jpg" alt="Deep Learning For Time Series Cookbook" height="256px" align="right"></a>

This is the code repository for [Deep Learning For Time Series Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/product/deep-learning-for-time-series-cookbook/9781805129233), published by Packt.

**Use PyTorch and Python recipes for forecasting, classification, and anomaly detection**

## What is this book about?

Many organizations, for example in finance, have some element of time dependency in their structures and processes. By leveraging time series analysis and forecasting, these organizations can make informed decisions and optimize their performance. Accurate forecasts help reduce uncertainty and enable better planning of operations. Unlike traditional approaches to forecasting, deep learning can process large amounts of data and help derive complex patterns. Despite its increasing relevance, getting the most out of deep learning requires significant technical expertise.
 
This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Grasp the core of time series analysis and unleash its power using Python
* Understand PyTorch and how to use it to build deep learning models
* Discover how to transform a time series for training transformers
* Understand how to deal with various time series characteristics
* Tackle forecasting problems, involving univariate or multivariate data
* Master time series classification with residual and convolutional neural networks
* Get up to speed with solving time series anomaly detection problems using autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs)

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal import seasonal_decompose 
result = seasonal_decompose(x=series_daily, model='additive', period=365)
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
If youâ€™re a machine learning enthusiast or someone who wants to learn more about building forecasting applications using deep learning, this book is for you. Basic knowledge of Python programming and machine learning is required to get the most out of this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-9).
